# About me

Hello! I am Lily, a second-year student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently getting my MS in Public Policy and Management. Iâ€™m originally from the Chicago area. Before coming to Carnegie Mellon, I got my Bachelor's in Mathematics with a minor in Statistics. After my undergraduate degree I joined the Peace Corps in Sierra Leone, where I worked as a mathematics teacher. Following my time in the Peace Corps, I worked at a few non-profits.  

# What I hope to learn

In this course, I hope to learn many new GIS skills, and work with international data, as well as data from events that are occurring presently. I also want to improve my geospatial analysis skills, which will in turn make me a better decision-maker and policymaker for international development organizations.
